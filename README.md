# Speech-Emotion-Recogniton

This project enables you to predict the mood of a human being by analyzing the speech of that person. The model is trained using ravdess dataset. Features are extracted, mfcc, chroma and mel from a sound file for their analysis. Randomforest classifier is used for analysis. Audio is recordered then feature engineered and after that it is feeded into the model for prediction.

You can download the dataset from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio
